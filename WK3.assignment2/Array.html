<!-- */Define data types-The fivr most basic data types or primitive types are, strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, and null. These are important concepts to be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the data type. A computer cannot safely solve or produce results without them.
const, var and let are all types of variables but have different permissions depending on the scope

//Using the Date type, calculate the date 12 months from now and write this into a web page.
